      <p>
        Since I was a kid, I wanted to pursue artâ€”drawing or painting, anything
        that let me have a creative outlet. But, having immigrant Asian parents
        and attending a small all-girls high school meant my career options were
        limited to healthcare or education. <br />

        So, I went into publishing, thinking it was a good comprimise between my
        creative needs and Ma's needs for financial security (it was not). When
        I started interning for a publishing house, I was put in the one and
        only team I feared: Web Development. Yet somehow, my teammates and I
        redesigned their website and I fell in love.<br />

        I set aside my romance writing dreams (and nursing according to Ma) to
        pursue a real romance of my own: I went off to study Interaction Design
        at Sheridan College and after, Computer Programming and Analysis at
        Seneca College.<br />

        I create warm and personal products, and believe in designs that
        celebrate individuality without sacrificing user experience.<br />

        Today, I continue to learn development and read romance on the side. I
        also hope to encourage more women towards tech and make their paths to
        code clearer than mine ever was.
